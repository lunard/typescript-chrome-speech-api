# Description
This project aims to create a Typescript wrapper for the W3C Speech API implemented by Google Chrome

# Introduction

# Tests
I use Jest and Puppeteer to run the tests on a headless Chrome browser.
Please refer to this nice intro on how configure the environment: https://medium.com/better-programming/how-to-use-puppeteer-with-jest-typescript-530a139ffe40

Another important reference is the jest-puppeteer preset documentation, in particular for the global variables browser, page and context:
